# Final companion SH8 documentation integration

Joy PR31 and Trisha PR28 replaced their pending SH8 statements with the actual
frozen S1 public-profile acceptance. Both link to immutable Trident commit
`a6b12e584719b69b64a606c5c4a54d6f6c7ae929`: its final acceptance audit, public
summary and Joy source bridge match the authenticated GitHub file bytes.
The published companion README bytes also match their exact reviewed Git blobs.

Each change touched one README. The documentation accepts both complete frozen
S1 self-build proofs in `joy-nox-disclosed-compiler-v1`, fresh verification,
exact C2/C3 artifacts, 547 corpus observations, 23 distinct rejections and two
original positive controls per generation. The original Joy `6e0ec4d` proof
installation and failed diagnostic histories remain explicit. Packaged Joy
host-ceiling and distribution validation retain their separate evidence.

The independent root source/install review, exact merge commands and their raw
outcomes are retained here. Both reviewed heads and both accepted merges passed
fresh-prefix offline Rust1.89 installation from source-equivalent accepted
archive paths, using existing warm fingerprints. The premerge drivers differ
from their reviewed predecessors only in the expected parent; postmerge copies
are byte-identical. Their guards retain the 120-second deadline, 64-MiB target
growth bound, 8-GiB free-space floor and refusal of compilation.

All four installs passed without warnings; source inputs and warm target sizes
remained unchanged. Joy retains binary SHA256
`7b1aee370f6826db73f089054f261a3ef874ad54d2e259fbd26f7d8164ab6071`;
Trisha retains `fe069879a44b582a47069c5cd849b1eb3da4c75a037e72aa9d107742ecc8173f`.
Exact commands, durations, source inventories and tool identities remain in
the original receipts. No native proof or CI workload was repeated.

Clean `docs/0.4-selfhost-integrated` branches now start at the two accepted
merges. Branch receipts bind the matching trees and clean before/after states.
Version/default-branch/tag/publication actions remain under the existing owner
policy. Trident's final closing integration is retained separately.

`retained-files.json` maps exact public originals to deduplicated SHA256 objects.
`references-only.json` preserves existing source-inventory identities and
duplicate immutable document-body identities. Executables, large proofs and
private host snapshots are excluded; binary identities remain in the install
receipts. Original absolute paths are provenance only.

Run `python3 -B -W error verify-retained.py --originals` where the recorded
original paths exist, or omit `--originals` for archive-only validation. The
verifier is unchanged SHA256
`7084b3e31fff02d78533e48998ac2994afc1cbd2744a6586fe9335315ceae446`.
Directory-local `* -text` preserves all bytes; whitespace exceptions apply
only to original raw objects.
